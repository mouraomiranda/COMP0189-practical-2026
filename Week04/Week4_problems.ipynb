    "1. Apply various regularized linear models to tabular data and optimize their regularization hyperparameter properly\n",
    "2. Learn how to visualize the coefficients of linear models\n",

    "### Dataset\n",
    "We will use the [Womxn in Big Data South Africa: Female-Headed Households in South Africa](https://zindi.africa/competitions/womxn-in-big-data-south-africa-female-headed-households-in-south-africa) challenge from the Zindi platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge associated with this dataset consists of developing a Machine Learning model that using the dataset features can predict the percentage of female-headed households in a ward that have an annual income lower than approximately 2.3 thousand dollars at the time the data was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has been developed using the data from the 2011 census in South Africa by aggregating key indicators that may be relevant in the context of the proposed task and that intuitively should have some connections - e.g. home type, school attendance, access to piped water, language, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "South Africa comprises over 4 thousand wards (i.e. geopolitical subdivisions of the country), and each feature in the dataset represents information about a specific ward, such as the prevalence of different types of dwellings or the prevalence of different population groups.\n",
